# SnakeAI
Python script that runs a Snake game and tries to resolve it through NN &amp; genetic algorithm

To start from 0 :

    > python3 snake_ia_no_interface.py

To start at generation 10 :

    > python3 snake_ia_no_interface.py 10
    
Each generation generates a number of snakes (300, 500, etc) and saves the 10 best to be replicated for the next generation.
These parameters can be changed at the top of the script.
